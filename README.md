# portscanner

This Port Scanner is written in Python, and used to target a specific IP on a network in order to scan a range of ports to see if they are open or closed.

Using the banner function, if a port is open it will display the banner for the open port. This can be helpful in determining the service that is allowed or running on the specified port.
